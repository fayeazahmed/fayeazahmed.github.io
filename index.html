								As lot of the development stuff in my location is still being

								wise to learn this classic server side language and a simple
								framework. So this a sample e-commerce site made using
								codeigniter 4 with dynamic product adding system.

								E-commerce web app, with django as backend taking care of
								postgresql migrations, and react on front. This is a somewhat
								repica of <span style="color: blue">Chaldal.com</span> which is
								a great site to order everyday stuff. This is quite a full stack
								project for my current caliber. Accounts can be created by
								users, orders and ordered products are added to their databases
								and relations established with foreign keys. If 10 orders are
								done from an account, it will get 10% discount on next orders.
								Django restapi and their authentication system is used. In the
								front end, react with react-router and redux were used. Product
								adding can be done from django admin dashboard, although as the
								server is hosted on heroku, new images can't be added as heroku
								don't provide static file storage. So I just added 2/3 products
								per category, as this is just a demonstration.

								ExpressJS and Postgres is used in the server, and React in
								client (PERN). So basically we can create an account with some
								basic information, follow other accounts, create posts
								optionally with photo, and add like or comment to a post. Feed
								will serve the contents posted by the user's account and the
								accounts that are being 'followed' by the user. Profile will
								contain only the user's posts. You can delete a post if it's
								made by you, and delete a comment if it's made by you or it
								belongs to a post made by you.<br />
								Also <span style="color: #ed6601">firebase</span>
								storage is used to store profile pictures and post photos. It's
								not a huge thing, but probably I learned the MOST till now
								creating this project.

								It's a classic diary like journal. You pick any date from the
								calendar and start writing whatever you want. So basically a
								user account keeps the jounral text stored for its respective
								date. Selecting a date creates entry in the database for that
								user and date, and if there's already a row in db for that
								speicific user and date, it retrieves it, so you can read or
								update. It's no ground breaking app, but after doing some full
								stack web with express/django, I wanted to get something up and
								running using asp.net asap to get myself comfortable with .NET.
								So I thought this would be cool, because I myself write journal
								everyday (on a diary in real life), so having a UI like that
								which can serve the same purpose felt the right project to
								build. So journals get stored in journal table with the date and
								userId. And if you are not logged in, then a random session id
								is generated and kept in local storage for reference, to keep
								the texts you write stored temporarily in another table . Then
								after authenticating, if there is data in the temporary table
								for that sessionId, then the respective rows are generated in
								the journal table for that user, and get deleted from temporary
								table. Used jwt for authentication. ASP .NET5 on back-end, React
								on front-end. Hosted the server on heroku using docker. So
								gained somewhat knowledge on docker as well.

								Pure vanilla javascript Spades card game. Well, not as
								intelligent as it sounds though :3 2 major things that I didn't
								attempt to implement considering it might take too long- There
								is no beginning call/bidding. You just keep on playing until you
								want and the points keeps getting added. Didn't bother including
								any "finish game" feature as well, just close the tab :v And
								next thing is the other players (cpu) do not consider the cards
								that previously been played in current round while playing a
								card. It selects the best card that can be played in this bid (
								if there's no higher card of leading suit, or a trump is already
								in play, then don't select a high card and some things like
								that). The icon of clubs suit is different cause that is the
								most similar thing I could find in fontawesome. It's not the
								best app to play Spades, but I definitely learnt a lot and did
								most problem solving making this.

								A web scraping project with python - beautfulsoup4. If one is
								looking to start contributing to open source, finding issues
								with the tag <span>good first issue</span> is a great way to
								start the journey. But it can be quite hard to find such issues
								manually going through different repositories. So here you
								search a term, flask server recieves it, web scraper searches
								for that in github, collects results for upto 5 pages, then goes
								thorugh them to find issues labeled with 'good first issue'.
								Then returns the data which is fetched using axios in client
								side. Performance wise, maybe using python wasn't really the
								best idea. I did a web scraping project with c# once, compared
								to that, this felt quite slower. But it's made primarily for
								project purposes, and I really wanted to use python in it. this.

								The first time I tried playing around with dot NET. This is a
								winform web scraping windows application. Enter name, and it
								will search for it in the piratebay, and show the list of only
								the important info like name of torrents, number of seed, leech
								and most importantly the magnet link. So just search, click
								magnet and default torrent client or appropriate pop up will
								show up.
